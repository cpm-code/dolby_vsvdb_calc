Dolby VSVDB and HDR InfoFrame Metadata Spreadsheet - This spreadsheet is to be used for generating Dolby VSVDB and/or HDR InfoFrame Metadata for cpm's CoreELEC build. The spreadsheet "Legend" on the top right of each tab/sheet will help to understand the cells color-coding. To change values you need to select the cell you want to change which will then show a drop-down button for you to select a valid value OR allow you to enter a value (if no drop-down button is shown). If the values on the cells are "*" you can increase the size of the column or row to be able to see the values. You must know your display/sink capabilities/specifications to put the correct values on the spreadsheet.
